            <p>Ayaan is a software developer, a logical thinker. He wants to build fundamentally sound software. He codes primarily in javascript.
            But if the situation calls for it., he codes in different languages and is willing to put down dedicated time,
            to learn new tools. At the end of the day, his primary goal is to write stable code.</p>

            <p>Everyday throws a new problem at him. To solve his problems, he is constantly in the pursuit of adding new tools to his belt.
            A certain part of his day is spent finding conceptual solutions to his problems. He then morphs these solutions
            into code. Once a week he meets up with his team to discuss the project he’s working on, and the team gets updated
            on the status. They might also discuss the new tools they might use, if the project is not going as was planned.</p>
